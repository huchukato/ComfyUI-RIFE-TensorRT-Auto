# 
# NOTE: This file is for REFERENCE ONLY - manual installation
# The recommended method is AUTO-INSTALLATION via the node:
# - Just install requirements.txt and restart ComfyUI
# - The node will auto-detect CUDA and install TensorRT automatically
#
# Use this file ONLY if auto-installation fails or for manual setup
#
# Installation order for MANUAL setup only:
# 1. pip install -r requirements.txt (base dependencies)
# 2. pip install -r requirements_cu12.txt (CUDA 12 specific TensorRT)
